# WeddingPlanner
First deployment projects using AWS EC2

The name of the application is Tying the Knot
You're able to register to the application and create a wedding event where other users/guests can rsvp and allow you to track how many people will be attending your wedding. On your dashboard, you will also see other wedding events that you can also rsvp to as well.
